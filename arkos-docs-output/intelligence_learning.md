# Intelligence & Learning in ark‑os‑noa

## Vision

ark‑os‑noa aspires to be more than an automation platform—it aims to embody **agentic intelligence**.  Intelligence here means the ability to understand complex systems (codebases, data sets, SaaS integrations), reason about them, learn from past executions, anticipate future scenarios, and adapt models and workflows accordingly.  Learning is achieved through a combination of semantic understanding (knowledge graphs and embeddings), model evaluation, feedback loops and simulation of alternative futures (“branchwise foresight”).

## Semantic Understanding

At the heart of ark‑os‑noa’s intelligence lies a **semantic representation** of the world:

* **Knowledge Graphs:** Built by the Graph Extract and Digest services, these graphs link code symbols, data entities, API endpoints, configuration keys and other artefacts.  They capture relationships (calls, imports, reads/writes, dependency edges) and annotate nodes with metadata (e.g. licence, language, risk).  Knowledge graphs enable graph‑based queries and reasoning—answering questions like “Which services write to table X?” or “What code paths handle payment processing?”
* **Embeddings & Vector DB:** The Embeddings Service converts source code, documentation and natural‑language descriptions into high‑dimensional vectors.  Stored in pgvector or Qdrant, these vectors power similarity search and clustering, enabling retrieval of semantically related items even if keywords differ.

## Model Evaluation & Evolution

The **ModelSelectorAgent** plays a central role in learning.  By recording the performance (latency, cost, accuracy) and outcomes of each model used for a task, the system builds a knowledge base of model behaviours.  Over time, the selector’s heuristics can be tuned or even replaced by learned policies that maximise utility subject to constraints.  Benchmark results and feedback loops allow the system to retire underperforming models and onboard new ones seamlessly.

## Feedback Loops & Trace Learning

Every execution produces a **Trace**—a record of inputs, actions, decisions, outputs and outcomes.  These traces are stored in Postgres along with logs and metrics.  Post‑run analyses mine these traces to identify patterns:

* **Success patterns:** Which workflows succeeded quickly with minimal retries?  Which models performed best on certain task types?
* **Failure modes:** Which tasks frequently hit policy violations or vulnerabilities?  Which connectors are unreliable?
* **Cost hot‑spots:** Where is budget being spent?  Are there cheaper alternatives?

Insights from these analyses can feed back into NOA’s planning and ModelSelector policies, closing the loop between execution and learning.

## Mind Maps & Branchwise Foresight

The system leverages the knowledge graph and embeddings to construct **mind maps**—visual or conceptual maps of relationships between components, tasks and dependencies.  These maps assist in reasoning about the impact of changes, identifying missing connections and planning new integrations.

**Branchwise foresight** refers to simulating multiple potential futures or scenarios before committing resources.  For example, before migrating a CRM function internally, NOA can instruct a MicroAgentStack to:

1. **Simulate Strategy A:** Keep the external CRM; use the strangler proxy in shadow mode; measure divergence.
2. **Simulate Strategy B:** Implement a minimal internal replacement for a specific endpoint; run synthetic load; compare latency and correctness.
3. **Simulate Strategy C:** Replace the CRM entirely with internal modules and measure performance, cost and user impact.

By comparing the outcomes of these branches, NOA and the Board Agents can choose a course of action informed by data rather than intuition.  This approach aligns with the idea of **compound AI systems**, where tasks are decomposed into specialised modules and their outputs orchestrated【438618440126565†L248-L292】.

## Continuous Learning & Improvement

Learning in ark‑os‑noa is continuous:

* **Auto‑patch loops:** When tests fail, Graph Extract proposes diffs, Runner applies them, and Safety verifies the fixes.  Successful patches can be proposed back to source repositories as pull requests.
* **Change intelligence:** Scheduled self‑digests detect changes in upstream sources; the system predicts breaking changes and generates migration guides.
* **Policy refinement:** The Board and NOA adjust policies (licence lists, vulnerability thresholds, model selection heuristics) based on operational data and emerging requirements.

By combining semantic representations, model analytics, feedback loops and foresight simulations, ark‑os‑noa evolves beyond a static workflow runner into an adaptive system capable of strategic reasoning and self‑improvement.
